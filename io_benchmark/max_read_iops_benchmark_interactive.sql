prompt This script asks for parameters to call then the actual benchmark script "max_read_iops_benchmark_harness.sql"
prompt which runs concurrent sessions performing physical read single block I/O mostly to report the achieved IOPS rate

prompt
prompt The script supports two modes: Synchronous I/O ("db file sequential read" / "cell single block physical read" on Exadata)
prompt and asynchronous I/O ("db file parallel read" / "cell list of blocks physical read" on Exadata)
prompt if supported on your configuration
prompt
prompt Please note that in order to max out the I/O using too small objects / a too large buffer cache will lead to
prompt logical instead of physical I/O.
prompt The objects created should be significantly larger than the buffer cache used for the tablespace assigned.
prompt
prompt Ideally, if you don't suspect caching effects on lower layers (or deliberately want to see their effects) you can use a very
prompt small buffer cache e.g. a minimum sized KEEP or RECYCLE buffer cache (one granule) using the block size that you want to test
prompt (usually the default block size)
prompt Then you don't need to create larger objects, the default of approx. 16.000 blocks per slave (two times 8.000 blocks for
prompt table and index) should be sufficient => 128 MB at 8 KB block size
prompt At the default number of slaves = 8 this means approx. 1 GB of space required. The buffer cache should be much smaller,
prompt as already mentioned, which it usually is at one granule (less than 64 MB typically).
@@common/interactive_common_prompt_2
prompt Currently the script supports up to 100.000.000 blocks per object, that is 1.600 GB at 8 KB block size per table + index
prompt combination per slave, so when using 8 slaves that is 12.800 GB.
prompt Probably you want to use more slaves when testing with such a large buffer cache, so can scale up accordingly,
prompt 32 slaves would mean 50 TB already.
prompt Of course this means you need that much space available in the target tablespace and the generation will take a while.
prompt By modifying the script "create_single_block_benchmark_objects.sql" you can easily create objects larger than
prompt 100.000.000 blocks, see the script header for comments in that regard.
prompt
prompt You'll now be prompted several questions and shown some information about
prompt required and available space as well as current cache sizes.

prompt Enter the mode to use for the benchmark. This can be either ASYNC (if supported by O/S / file system configuration) or SYNC I/O

prompt Synchronous single block I/O is mainly "db file sequential read" (or "cell single block physical read" on Exadata)
